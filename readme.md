# ADL LRS

_Note:_ This LRS has recently been updated to match the IEEE 9274.1.1 Base Standard -- also known as xAPI 2.0.

This version is stable, but only intended to support a small amount of users as a proof of concept.

## Installation

The simplest way to install the ADL LRS is via Docker and Docker Compose. You can find detailed instructions on this process [here](https://github.com/adlnet/ADL_LRS/wiki).
